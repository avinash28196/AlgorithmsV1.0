## Insertion Sort

* Insertion sort iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted output list.
* At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it there.
* It repeats until no input elements remain.

Sorting is typically done in-place, by iterating up the array, growing the sorted list behind it. At each array-position, it checks the value there against the largest value in the sorted list (which happens to be next to it, in the previous array-position checked). If larger, it leaves the element in place and moves to the next. If smaller, it finds the correct position within the sorted list, 
shifts all the larger values up to make a space, and inserts into that correct position.


## Best, worst, and average cases

* The best case input is an array that is already sorted. In this case insertion sort has a linear running time (i.e., O(n)). During each iteration, the first remaining element of the input is only compared with the right-most element of the sorted subsection of the array.
* The simplest worst case input is an array sorted in reverse order. The set of all worst case inputs consists of all arrays where each element is the smallest or second-smallest of the elements before it. In these cases every iteration of the inner loop will scan and shift the entire sorted subsection of the array before inserting the next element. 
  This gives insertion sort a quadratic running time (i.e., O(n2)).
* The average case is also quadratic[5], which makes insertion sort impractical for sorting large arrays. However, insertion sort is one of the fastest algorithms for sorting very small arrays, even faster than quicksort indeed.


*Advantage:* nsertion sort is used when number of elements is small. It can also be useful when input array is almost sorted, only few elements are misplaced in complete big array.

```java

// Java program for implementation of Insertion Sort 
class InsertionSort { 
    /*Function to sort array using insertion sort*/
    void sort(int arr[]) 
    { 
        int n = arr.length; 
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) { 
            int key = arr[i]; 
            int j = i - 1; 
  
            /* Move elements of arr[0..i-1], that are 
               greater than key, to one position ahead 
               of their current position */
            while (j >= 0 && arr[j] > key) { 
                arr[j + 1] = arr[j]; 
                j = j - 1; 
            } 
            arr[j + 1] = key; 
        } 
    } 
  
    /* A utility function to print array of size n*/
    static void printArray(int arr[]) 
    { 
        int n = arr.length; 
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) 
            System.out.print(arr[i] + " "); 
  
        System.out.println(); 
    } 
  
    // Driver method 
    public static void main(String args[]) 
    { 
        int arr[] = { 12, 11, 13, 5, 6 }; 
  
        InsertionSort ob = new InsertionSort(); 
        ob.sort(arr); 
  
        printArray(arr); 
    } 
}
```
